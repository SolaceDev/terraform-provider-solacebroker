Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `""`.
- `authentication_kerberos_keytab_file_name` (String) The name of this User Principal's keytab file.

Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `""`.
- `authentication_scheme` (String) The authentication scheme for the Kafka Sender. The bootstrap addresses must resolve to an appropriately configured and compatible listener port on the Kafka broker for the given scheme. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `"none"`. The allowed values and their meaning are:

<pre>
"none" - Anonymous Authentication. Used with Kafka broker PLAINTEXT listener ports.
"basic" - Basic Authentication. Used with Kafka broker SASL_PLAINTEXT and SASL_SSL listener ports.
"scram" - Salted Challenge Response Authentication. Used with Kafka broker SASL_PLAINTEXT and SASL_SSL listener ports.
"client-certificate" - Client Certificate Authentication. Used with Kafka broker SSL listener ports.
"kerberos" - Kerberos Authentication.
"oauth-client" - Oauth Authentication. Used with Kafka broker SASL_SSL listener ports.
</pre>
- `authentication_scram_hash` (String) The hash used for SCRAM authentication. To be used when authentication_scheme is "scram". Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `"sha-512"`. The allowed values and their meaning are:

<pre>
"sha-256" - SHA-2 256 bits.
"sha-512" - SHA-2 512 bits.
</pre>
- `authentication_scram_username` (String) The username the Kafka Sender uses to login to the remote Kafka broker. To be used when authentication_scheme is "scram". Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `""`.
- `batch_delay` (Number) Delay (in ms) to wait to accumulate a batch of messages to send. Batching is done for all Senders on a per-partition basis.

This corresponds to the Kafka producer API `linger.ms` configuration setting.

Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `5`.
- `batch_max_msg_count` (Number) Maximum number of messages sent in a single batch. Batching is done for all Senders on a per-partition basis. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `10000`.
- `batch_max_size` (Number) Maximum size of a message batch, in bytes (B). Batching is done for all Senders on a per-partition basis.

This corresponds to the Kafka producer API `batch.size` configuration setting, and should not exceed either the Kafka broker `message.max.bytes` configuration setting, or the per-Topic override of `max.message.bytes`.

Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `1000000`.

Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `""`.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Enable or disable the Kafka Sender. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `false`.
- `idempotence_enabled` (Boolean) Enable or disable idempotence for the Kafka Sender. Idempotence guarantees in order at-least-once message delivery to the remote Kafka Topic, at the expense of performance. When idempotence is enabled the Queue Bindings of the Kafka Sender must have ack_mode of "all" to be operational.

This corresponds to the Kafka producer API `enable.idempotence` configuration setting.

Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `false`.
- `transport_compression_enabled` (Boolean) Enable or disable compression for the Kafka Sender. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `false`.
- `transport_compression_level` (Number) Compression level. The valid range is dependent on the compression type.

This corresponds to the Kafka producer API `compression.level` configuration setting.

Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `-1`.
- `transport_compression_type` (String) Compression type. Only relevant if compression is enabled.

This corresponds to the Kafka producer API `compression.type` configuration setting.

Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `"gzip"`. The allowed values and their meaning are:

"snappy" - Snappy Compression.
"lz4" - LZ4 Compression.
"zstd" - Zstandard Compression.
</pre>
- `transport_tls_enabled` (Boolean) Enable or disable encryption (TLS) for the Kafka Sender. The bootstrap addresses must resolve to PLAINTEXT or SASL_PLAINTEXT listener ports when disabled, and SSL or SASL_SSL listener ports when enabled. Modifying this attribute while the object (or the relevant part of the object) is administratively enabled may be service impacting as enabled will be temporarily set to false to apply the change. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync. The default value is `false`.
